 The basic steps to use the software are as follows:
 1. **Get a trained model** for your inference task. Example inference tasks: pedestrian detection, face detection, vehicle detection, license plate recognition, head pose.
2. **Run the trained model through the Model Optimizer** to convert the model to an Intermediate Representation, which consists of a pair of .xml and .bin files that are used as the input for Inference Engine.
3. **Use the Inference Engine API** in an application to run inference against the Intermediate Representation (optimized model) and output inference results. The application can be an OpenVINO™ sample, demo, or your own application.

Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit includes the following components:
- Deep Learning Model Optimizer: A cross-platform command-line tool for importing models and preparing them for optimal execution with the Inference Engine. The Model Optimizer imports, converts, and optimizes models, which were trained in popular frameworks, such as Caffe*, TensorFlow*, MXNet*, Kaldi*, and ONNX*.
- Deep Learning Inference Engine: A unified API to allow high performance inference on many hardware types including Intel® CPU, Intel® Integrated Graphics, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ vision processing unit (VPU).
- Inference Engine Samples: A set of simple console applications demonstrating how to use the Inference Engine in your applications.
- Deep Learning Workbench: A web-based graphical environment that allows you to easily use various sophisticated OpenVINO™ toolkit components.
- Post-training Optimization Tool: A tool to calibrate a model and then execute it in the INT8 precision.
- Additional Tools: A set of tools to work with your models including Benchmark App, Cross Check Tool, Compile tool.
- Open Model Zoo 
   - Demos: Console applications that provide robust application templates to help you implement specific deep learning scenarios.
   - Additional Tools: A set of tools to work with your models including Accuracy Checker Utility and Model Downloader.
   - Documentation for Pretrained Models: Documentation for pre-trained models that are available in the Open Model Zoo repository.
- Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer): Streaming analytics framework, based on GStreamer, for constructing graphs of media analytics components. DL Streamer can be installed by the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit installer. Its open-source version is available on GitHub. For the DL Streamer documentation, see:
   - DL Streamer Samples
   - API Reference
   - Elements
   - Tutorial
- OpenCV : OpenCV* community version compiled for Intel® hardware
- Intel® Media SDK (in Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux only)
 

## OpenVINO™ Toolkit Directory Structure

**LINUX**

This guide assumes you completed all Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit installation and configuration steps. If you have not yet installed and configured the toolkit, see [Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux*](../install_guides/installing-openvino-linux.md).

By default, the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ is installed to the following directory, referred to as `<INSTALL_DIR>`:
* For root or administrator: `/opt/intel/openvino_<version>/`
* For regular users: `/home/<USER>/intel/openvino_<version>/`

For simplicity, a symbolic link to the latest installation is also created: `/home/<user>/intel/openvino_2021/`

If you installed the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to a directory other than the default, replace `/opt/intel` or `/home/<USER>/` with the directory in which you installed the software.

The primary tools for deploying your models and applications are installed to the `/opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools` directory.

## Get Started with Demo Scripts and Samples

The Get Started page walks you through the exercises that are an introduction to using OpenVINO to run samples and demos, and a quick introduction to tools such as the Model Optimizer. The exercises are intended to become more difficult as you progress. The early exercises provide step-by-step instructions, while later exercises give more general guidance. The goal is to teach developers the concepts and skills needed to use all of the resources available for OpenVINO. [Get Started Page](../get_started.md)
