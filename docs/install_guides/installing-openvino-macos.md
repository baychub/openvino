## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for macOS*.

The following steps will be covered:

1. <a href="#install-core">Install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit</a>
2. <a href="#set-the-environment-variables">Configure the Environment</a>
3. <a href="#model-optimizer">Configure the Model Optimizer (Optional)</a>
4. <a href="#get-started">Get Started with Code Samples and Demo Applications</a>
- [Steps to uninstall the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit](../install_guides/uninstalling_openvino.md)

## <a name="install-core"></a>Step 1: Install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit Core Components

If you have a previous version of the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit installed, rename or delete these two directories:

- `~/inference_engine_samples`
- `~/openvino_models`

[Download the latest version of OpenVINO toolkit for macOS*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download/free-download-macos), then return to this guide to proceed with the installation.

Install the OpenVINO toolkit core components:

1. Go to the directory where you downloaded the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. This document assumes this is your `Downloads` directory. By default, the disk image file is saved as `m_openvino_toolkit_p_<version>.dmg`.

2. Double-click the `m_openvino_toolkit_p_<version>.dmg` file to mount.
The disk image is mounted to `/Volumes/m_openvino_toolkit_p_<version>` and automatically opens in a separate window.

3. Run the installation wizard application `m_openvino_toolkit_p_<version>.app`.

4. On the **User Selection** screen, choose a user account for the installation:
    - Root
    - Administrator
    - Current user

   The default installation directory path depends on the privileges you choose for the installation.

5. Follow the instructions on your screen. Watch for informational messages such as the following in case you must complete additional steps:

   ![](../img/openvino-install-macos-02.png)

6. The **Installation summary** screen shows you the default component set to install. By default, the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ is installed in the following directory, referred to as `<INSTALL_DIR>` elsewhere in the documentation:

   * For root or administrator: `/opt/intel/openvino_<version>/`
   * For regular users: `~/intel/openvino_<version>/`

   For simplicity, a symbolic link to the latest installation is also created: `<INSTALL_DIR>/intel/openvino_2021/`.

7. **Optional**: You can choose **Customize** to change the installation directory or the components you want to install:
> **NOTE**: If there is an OpenVINO™ toolkit version previously installed on your system, the installer will use the same destination directory for next installations. If you want to install a newer version to a different directory, you need to uninstall the previously installed versions.

8. The Finish screen indicates that the core components have been installed:
   ![](../img/openvino-install-macos-05.png)

> **NOTE**: After you click Finish to close the installation wizard, a new browser window opens with the document you’re reading now (in case you installed without it) and jumps to the section with the next installation steps.

The core components are now installed. If you received a message that you were missing external software dependencies (list available under Software Requirements at the top of this guide), you need to install them now before continuing to the next section.

## <a name="set-the-environment-variables"></a>Step 2: Configure the Environment

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO™ applications. Set persistent environment variables as follows, using vi (as below) or your preferred editor in the terminal:

1. Open the `.bash_profile` file in the current user home directory:
   ```sh
   vi ~/.bash_profile
   ```

2. Press the **i** key to switch to insert mode.

3. Add this line to the end of the file:
   ```sh
   source /opt/intel/openvino_2021/bin/setupvars.sh
   ```

   If you didn't choose the default installation option, replace `/opt/intel/openvino_2021` with your directory.

4. Save and close the file: press the **Esc** key, type `:wq` and press the **Enter** key.

5. To verify the change, open a new terminal. You will see `[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO environment initialized`.

   **Optional:** If you don't want to change your shell profile, you can run the following script to temporarily set your environment variables when working with the OpenVINO* toolkit:

   ```sh
   source /opt/intel/openvino_2021/bin/setupvars.sh
   ```  

The environment variables are set. Continue to the next section to configure the Model Optimizer.

The Model Optimizer is a Python\*-based command line tool for importing
trained models from popular deep learning frameworks such as Caffe\*,
TensorFlow\*, Apache MXNet\*, ONNX\* and Kaldi\*.

The Model Optimizer is a key component of the OpenVINO toolkit. You cannot perform inference on your trained model without running the model through the Model Optimizer. When you run a pre-trained model through the Model Optimizer, your output is an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the network. The IR is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

- `.xml`: Describes the network topology
- `.bin`: Contains the weights and biases binary data

The Inference Engine reads, loads, and infers the IR files, using a common API on the CPU hardware.

For more information about the Model Optimizer, see the [Model Optimizer Developer Guide](../MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md).

### <a name="model-optimizer"></a>Step 3 (Optional): Configure the Model Optimizer

If you see error messages, verify that you installed all dependencies listed under **Software Requirements** at the top of this guide.

1. Go to the Model Optimizer prerequisites directory:
   ```sh
   cd /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/install_prerequisites
   ```

2. Run the script to configure the Model Optimizer for Caffe, TensorFlow 2.x, MXNet, Kaldi\*, and ONNX:
   ```sh
   sudo ./install_prerequisites.sh
   ```

**Optional:** You can choose to configure each framework separately instead, to save disk space. If you see error messages, make sure you installed all dependencies.

Configure individual frameworks separately **ONLY** if you did not select **Option 1** above.

1. Go to the Model Optimizer prerequisites directory:
   ```sh
   cd /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/install_prerequisites
   ```

2. Run the script for your model framework. You can run more than one script.

> **NOTE**: You can choose to install Model Optimizer support for only certain frameworks. In the same directory are individual scripts for Caffe, TensorFlow 1.x, TensorFlow 2.x, MXNet, Kaldi*, and ONNX (install_prerequisites_caffe.sh, etc.).

The Model Optimizer is configured for one or more frameworks.

You have completed all required installation, configuration and build steps in this guide to use your CPU to work with your trained models. 

To enable inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, see the <a href="#additional-NCS2-steps">Steps for Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2</a>. 

Or proceed to the <a href="#get-started">Get Started</a> guide to start running code samples and demo applications.

## <a name="additional-NCS2-steps"></a>Steps for Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2

These steps are required only if you want to perform inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2
powered by the Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X VPU. For more details, see also the
[Get Started page for Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2](https://software.intel.com/en-us/neural-compute-stick/get-started).

To perform inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, the `libusb` library is required. You can build it from the [source code](https://github.com/libusb/libusb) or install using the macOS package manager you prefer: [Homebrew*](https://brew.sh/), [MacPorts*](https://www.macports.org/) or other.

For example, to install the `libusb` library using Homebrew\*, use the following command:
```sh
brew install libusb
```

You've completed all required configuration steps to perform inference on your Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2. 
Proceed to the <a href="#get-started">Get Started</a> guide to get started with running code samples and demo applications.

## <a name="get-started"></a>Step 4: Start Using the Toolkit

Now you are ready to try out the toolkit. To continue, see the following pages:
* [OpenVINO™ Toolkit Overview](../index.md)
* [Get Started Guide](../get_started/get_started_guide.md) to see the basic OpenVINO™ toolkit workflow and run code samples and demo applications with pre-trained models on different inference devices.
